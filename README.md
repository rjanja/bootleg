**Bootleg** is a simple set of commands that attempt to simplify building and deploying Elixir applications. The goal of the project is to provide an extensible framework that can support many different deployment scenarios with one common set of commands.

Out of the box, Bootleg provides remote build and remote server automation for your [Distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery) releases. Bootleg assumes your project is committed into a **git** repository and some of the build steps use this assumption
to handle code within the build process. If you are using another source control management (SCM) tool please consider contributing to Bootleg to
add additional support.

## Installation

```
def deps do
  [{:distillery, "~> 2.0", runtime: false},
   {:bootleg, "~> 0.8", runtime: false}]
end
```

## Help

We're usually around on Slack where you can find us on [elixir-lang's #bootleg channel](http://elixir-lang.slack.com/messages/bootleg/) if you have any questions.

## Acknowledgments

Bootleg makes heavy use of the [bitcrowd/SSHKit.ex](https://github.com/bitcrowd/sshkit.ex)
library under the hood. We are very appreciative of the efforts of the bitcrowd team for both creating SSHKit.ex and being so attentive to our requests. We're also grateful for the opportunity to collaborate
on ideas for both projects!
